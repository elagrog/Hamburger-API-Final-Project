# Hamburger API Final Project 

This [API documentation](Documentation.md) is for ordering a hamburger in a diner. It is intended for developers to know how to use this API so that they can develop one and provide a proof of concept to the diner owners. It was based on snippets of code, provided by the SME.

This API includes two calls: 
* GET used to get commands from the server. In this case, it will be to get the bill
* Post - used to send the commands to the server.  In this case, the post will send the customer's order to the kitchen. 
Another API needs to be created for the payment system. 

## Purpose of the API 
*	The cook needs to be able to view all the orders placed in the order of arrival.
* The customer needs to be able to place an order
* The customer needs to be able to know the order status
